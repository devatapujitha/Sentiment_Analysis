Sentence
Alexa's tendency to misunderstand commands and provide irrelevant responses can be frustrating.
"Alexa's voice can sound robotic and unnatural at times, detracting from the overall user experience."
I love how Alexa can provide instant answers to questions and perform tasks with just a voice command.
The need for a stable internet connection for Alexa to function properly can be a drawback in unreliable networks.
"This item did not work. Certified refurbished should mean it works as advertised. Instead this item crashed as soon as I turned it on and plugged it in. When trying to connect from my phone to the echo dot, it crashed, over and over. Not only would it disconnect but the orange light would freeze and then the thing would reboot with the blue light. Alexa would tell me it’s ready to connect and freeze mid sentence. Tried holding the action button for 5 seconds and it didn’t do anything. Returning immediately and hope they actually fix this item when the next buyer purchases it."
Does not work all the time
I've already returned it.
